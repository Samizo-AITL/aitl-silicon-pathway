# Glossary

- **FSM**: Finite State Machine (controller logic with states and transitions)
- **Moore**: outputs depend only on the current state
- **Mealy**: outputs depend on current state and inputs
- **RTL**: Register Transfer Level code describing sequential + combinational logic
- **Synthesis**: translating RTL into a gate-level netlist
- **OpenLane**: open-source ASIC flow (synthesis to layout), used here at concept level
- **Checkpoint**: a minimal criterion to judge if RTL is hardware-valid
